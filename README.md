# django_react_blog
 I used django as backend with postgresql , django-rest-framework api ,React as frontend .
 Also I used Bootstrap for design, and Context hook for state management. 
 So many things in one simple Django React Blog Project.
 
 I got an error while using createContext ,first I was using Context.Consumer . Project was working
 fine but got an error in cosole again and again.
 
 Error was " Can't render home component at the same time while Consumer was rendering.
 So i use "useContext" instead and it solves the problem.
 
 I am using "axios" in "Layout.js" file, and there i am using "React.createContext" .
 So all state availble in every comopnent.
 So i don't have to use redux.
 
 Although ,I know how to work with Redux , I think Context Hook can replace Redux easliy, its simple
 to work with.
 
 Also I am first time working with "Postgresql" , before that i was using Mysql or Sqlite in my earlier
 projects.
 "Postgresql" is very easy to install,connect ,and as a Django developer , I know "Postgresql" provides
 lots of things which other sql database don't provide.
 It is known as best database for Django.
 
 There are still some things are in my mind regarding this project. I am gonna update those things in 
 future.
